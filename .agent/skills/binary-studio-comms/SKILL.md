# Binary Studio Communication Guide

This skill provides the complete communication framework for **Binary Studio**, a design and development studio. Use it to generate any content aligned with the studio's brand identity, voice, and strategy.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when:

- Writing social media captions, bios, or post copy for Binary Studio
- Creating web copy (landing pages, about sections, service descriptions)

- Generating content ideas or editorial calendars
- Writing email campaigns or newsletters

## Brand Overview

**Binary Studio** is a full-service design studio with a technical edge. The name plays on binary code (1s and 0s), reflecting an approach that merges design with technology — clarity, precision, and systems thinking applied to visual communication.

**What We Do:** Everything the client needs. Branding, web design & development, UX/UI, editorial design, packaging, presentations, communication strategy, and more. We don't specialize in one thing — we specialize in solving problems through design. Whatever the challenge, we find a way.

**How We Work:** Hand-in-hand with clients. We listen first, understand the problem, then propose the best solutions. We put our expertise on the table, explain the "why" behind every decision, but the final call is always yours. We don't say yes to everything just to keep clients happy — we say what we believe is best, informed by experience.

## How to Use This Skill

### For Brand Identity (colors, fonts, logo)
Read `references/brand-identity.md` for the complete visual identity system including color palette, typography, logo usage rules, and visual style guidelines.

### For Writing Copy
1. First read `references/voice-and-tone.md` to understand the brand personality and how to write as Binary Studio
2. Then reference `references/copywriting-templates.md` for ready-to-use templates for different formats (captions, bios, CTAs, headlines)

### For Content Planning
Read `references/content-strategy.md` to understand the content pillars, target audiences, and channel strategy.

### For Social Media
Read `references/social-media-guidelines.md` for platform-specific formatting, category tags, caption structure, hashtags, and posting cadence.

### For Visual Assets
The `assets/` directory contains the Binary Studio logos:
- `assets/logo-full.svg` — Full logo: B1NARY STUDI0
- `assets/logo-reduced.svg` — Reduced logo: 01

### For AI Image Generation
Read `references/image-generation.md` for the complete visual style system including base prompts, prompt templates by resource type (portraits, objects, abstracts, mockups), photo editing guidelines, and a ready-to-use Gemini Gem system prompt.

## Critical Rules

1. **Always use Argentine Spanish** (voseo) as the default language unless explicitly asked for English
2. **Never be corporate** — Binary Studio is a small, approachable studio, not a faceless agency
3. **Anglicisms are OK** when standard in design/tech (branding, UX, wireframe, layout, etc.)
4. **Tone varies by context** — See `references/voice-and-tone.md` for the tone spectrum
5. **Content must serve one of the defined pillars** — See `references/content-strategy.md`
6. **Always respect the visual identity** — Colors, fonts, and logo usage per `references/brand-identity.md`
7. **Every slide must teach or add value** — No filler slides. Each carousel slide must contain a concrete idea, data, example, or actionable info
8. **Covers lead with a hook** — The main title is always a provocative/curiosity-driven statement, never just the topic name. See the cover structure in `references/social-media-guidelines.md`
9. **AI-generated images follow the Binary style** — Always use the base prompt from `references/image-generation.md`
